# DEPRECATION NOTICE

This dataset is now included in [moabb](https://moabb.neurotechx.com/docs/generated/moabb.datasets.Cattan2019_VR.html#moabb.datasets.Cattan2019_VR)

# EEG Virtual Reality dataset

Repository with basic scripts for using the EEG Virtual Reality developed at GIPSA-lab [1]. The dataset files and their documentation are all available at 

[https://zenodo.org/record/2605205/](https://zenodo.org/record/2605205/)

The code of this repository was developed in Python 3 using MOABB [2] and MNE-Python [3, 4] as tools for downloading and pre-processing the dataset.
It is compatible with **Python 3.8 and 3.9**.

To make things work, you will need to install MOABB. It can be done by following the instructions at the project's GitHub [link](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb).

You might also need to install some packages. They are all listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be easily installed by doing

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

in your command line. 

Then, to ensure that your code finds the right scripts whenever you do `import virtualreality`, you should also do

```
python setup.py develop # because no stable release yet
```

Note that you might want to create a *virtual environment* before doing all these installations.
